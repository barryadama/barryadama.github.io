### Welcome to my personal page!

I am a **PhD in Statistics and Data Science** from the **University of Toulouse**, with expertise in **Gaussian process emulation**, **Bayesian optimization**, and **expensive computer code calibration**.

I graduated as an engineer from [**ENSAI**](https://ensai.fr/en/) (*Statistical Engineering*) and [**INSEA**](https://insea.ac.ma/) (*Statistics and Applied Economics*). My background bridges **theoretical statistics** and **applied data science**, with a growing focus on **artificial intelligence**.

My research interests focus on the **development and understanding of machine learning models**, particularly their **mathematical foundations** and **implementation from scratch**.

Through this page, I aim to share my **learnings**, **experiments**, and **projects** in data science and AI.
