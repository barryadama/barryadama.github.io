### üëã Welcome to my personal page!

I am a **PhD in Statistics and Data Science** from the **University of Toulouse**, specializing in **Gaussian Process (GP) emulation**, **Bayesian optimization**, and **calibration of expensive computer models**.  

My doctoral research was jointly supervised by [**Prof. Cl√©mentine Prieur**](https://membres-ljk.imag.fr/Clementine.Prieur/) (University of Grenoble Alpes), [**Prof. Fran√ßois Bachoc**](https://francoisbachoc.github.io/) (University of Lille), [**Dr. Miguel Mu√±oz Z√∫√±iga**](https://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.fr/node/900), and [**Dr. Sarah Bouquet**](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sarah-Bouquet) (IFP Energies Nouvelles).  

I hold dual engineering degrees from [**ENSAI**](https://ensai.fr/en/) (*Statistical Engineering*) and [**INSEA**](https://insea.ac.ma/) (*Statistics and Applied Economics*).  
My academic background bridges **theoretical statistics** and **applied data science**, with an increasing focus on **artificial intelligence** and **uncertainty quantification**.


My research interests focus on the **development and understanding of machine learning models**, particularly their **mathematical foundations** and **implementation from scratch**.

Through this page, I aim to share my **learnings**, **experiments**, and **projects** in data science and AI.
