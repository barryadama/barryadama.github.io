    "text": "PhD Thesis Manuscript\n\nDesign of Experiments for Expensive Computer Code Calibration\nDate: June 25, 2025\nPublished on: HAL\nAbstract:\nThis thesis focuses on the Bayesian calibration of expensive computer codes—with scalar, vector, or functional outputs—using a limited number of physical measurements. A computer code is considered expensive when its evaluation requires significant computational time. In such contexts, Bayesian inference on its parameters requires the use of a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian process emulator.\nWe propose a two-stage strategy combining the optimal selection of physical experiments (for field measurements) and numerical experiments (for emulator construction). The first stage involves building an initial Gaussian process emulator, which is then used to compute optimality criteria for physical experimental design.\nTwo families of criteria are introduced:\n1. Bayesian criteria based on the posterior distribution of calibration parameters, incorporating uncertainties from physical and numerical observations as well as model parameters.\n2. A code variation–based criterion, which combines model sensitivity with the space-filling properties of the design, offering reduced computational cost for optimization.\nFour optimization algorithms are explored: simulated annealing, a greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA). After cog physical data, the emulator is refined via sequential design of numerical experiments, guided by acquisition criteria that progressively reduce calibration uncertainty. Two calibration-oriented acquisition criteria are proposed: the sum of posterior variances of calibration parameters, and the prediction error of physical observations.\nThe final emulator is used to approximate the posterior density of the parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling combined with kernel-based nonparametric estimation.\nThe methodology is validated on scalar-output analytical functions, compared with state-of-the-art approaches, and then extended to vector- and function-valued computer codes. Finally, it is applied to the Bayesian calibration of a numerical simulator dedicated to geological CO₂ storage, using synthetic data."

In a calibration process with costly measurement acquisition and high computing time of the computer code, the estimation accuracy and cost mitigation must guide the selection of the design of physical experiments and of numerical experiments. To this end, we propose a hybrid approach to select both designs of physical and numerical experiments with the aim to approximate the posterior density of calibration parameters. We first build an initial Gaussian process emulator which we use to calculate an optimal physical experimental design criterion. Then, after selecting the physical experimental design, we combine physical observations with available computer code evaluations to sequentially add new points to the design of numerical experiments in order to improve the Gaussian process emulator for the calibration purpose. We introduce three new criteria for selecting the design of physical experiments based on posterior density or computer code variation and two new criteria for selecting the design of numerical experiments inspired by the Sequential Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) paradigm. A performance analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art methods is proposed for two test cases and a more realistic one involving the calibration of a harmonic oscillator."
