    "text": "PhD Thesis Manuscript\n\nDesign of Experiments for Expensive Computer Code Calibration\nDate: June 25, 2025\nPublished on: HAL\nAbstract:\nThis thesis focuses on the Bayesian calibration of expensive computer codes‚Äîwith scalar, vector, or functional outputs‚Äîusing a limited number of physical measurements. A computer code is considered expensive when its evaluation requires significant computational time. In such contexts, Bayesian inference on its parameters requires the use of a surrogate model, typically a Gaussian process emulator.\nWe propose a two-stage strategy combining the optimal selection of physical experiments (for field measurements) and numerical experiments (for emulator construction). The first stage involves building an initial Gaussian process emulator, which is then used to compute optimality criteria for physical experimental design.\nTwo families of criteria are introduced:\n1. Bayesian criteria based on the posterior distribution of calibration parameters, incorporating uncertainties from physical and numerical observations as well as model parameters.\n2. A code variation‚Äìbased criterion, which combines model sensitivity with the space-filling properties of the design, offering reduced computational cost for optimization.\nFour optimization algorithms are explored: simulated annealing, a greedy algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA). After cog physical data, the emulator is refined via sequential design of numerical experiments, guided by acquisition criteria that progressively reduce calibration uncertainty. Two calibration-oriented acquisition criteria are proposed: the sum of posterior variances of calibration parameters, and the prediction error of physical observations.\nThe final emulator is used to approximate the posterior density of the parameters via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling combined with kernel-based nonparametric estimation.\nThe methodology is validated on scalar-output analytical functions, compared with state-of-the-art approaches, and then extended to vector- and function-valued computer codes. Finally, it is applied to the Bayesian calibration of a numerical simulator dedicated to geological CO‚ÇÇ storage, using synthetic data."

In a calibration process with costly measurement acquisition and high computing time of the computer code, the estimation accuracy and cost mitigation must guide the selection of the design of physical experiments and of numerical experiments. To this end, we propose a hybrid approach to select both designs of physical and numerical experiments with the aim to approximate the posterior density of calibration parameters. We first build an initial Gaussian process emulator which we use to calculate an optimal physical experimental design criterion. Then, after selecting the physical experimental design, we combine physical observations with available computer code evaluations to sequentially add new points to the design of numerical experiments in order to improve the Gaussian process emulator for the calibration purpose. We introduce three new criteria for selecting the design of physical experiments based on posterior density or computer code variation and two new criteria for selecting the design of numerical experiments inspired by the Sequential Uncertainty Reduction (SUR) paradigm. A performance analysis and comparison with state-of-the-art methods is proposed for two test cases and a more realistic one involving the calibration of a harmonic oscillator."

    "text": "Gaussian Process Surrogate Modeling\nIn modern scientific computing and engineering, evaluating complex models or simulators can often be computationally expensive. Each simulation may take minutes, hours, or even days to complete making tasks like optimization, uncertainty quantification, or sensitivity analysis extremely challenging.\nTo overcome this, researchers increasingly rely on surrogate models (also called emulators or metamodels). These models aim to approximate the behavior of a costly function using a much cheaper-to-evaluate statistical representation. Among the various approaches, Gaussian Process (GP) modeling has become one of the most popular and powerful techniques.\nA Gaussian Process provides a probabilistic framework to represent uncertainty about the function being modeled. It not only predicts the function‚Äôs value at unseen points but also quantifies the confidence in each prediction. This property makes GPs particularly suited for Bayesian optimization, sequential experimental design, and uncertainty propagation.\nIn this article, we introduce the key concepts behind Gaussian Process surrogate modeling ‚Äî explaining how it works, why it is so effective, and how it can be applied to real-world problems where exhaustive simulation is computationally infeasible.‚û°Ô∏è Continue reading‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nDesign of experiments\nIn scientific research, engineering, and data-driven modeling, exploring the relationship between inputs and outputs often requires running experiments or simulations. However, when each experiment is costly or time-consuming, it becomes crucial to plan them strategically. This is where the Design of Experiments (DoE) methodology comes into play.\nDesign of Experiments provides a systematic and quantitative framework for selecting informative combinations of input variables. Instead of performing random or exhaustive trials, DoE aims to maximize information gain while minimizing the number of experiments or simulations required.\nOriginally developed for physical experiments in agriculture and industry, DoE has evolved into a cornerstone of computational science, machine learning, and uncertainty quantification. It enables researchers to build accurate surrogate models, perform sensitivity analyses, and guide sequential optimization processes efficiently.\nA well-designed experimental plan not only improves model accuracy but also enhances interpretability and robustness, allowing better understanding of complex systems under uncertainty.\nIn this article, we introduce the fundamental principles of Design of Experiments ‚Äî what it is, why it matters, and how it can be leveraged to accelerate scientific discovery and data-driven modeling.‚û°Ô∏è Continue reading‚Ä¶\n\n\n\nAcademic Projects\nDuring my studies at ENSAI (√âcole Nationale de la Statistique et de l‚ÄôAnalyse de l‚ÄôInformation), I had the opportunity to work on several academic projects combining statistics, data science, and machine learning.\nThese projects allowed me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world problems ‚Äî from data exploration and predictive modeling.‚û°Ô∏è Continue reading‚Ä¶"
